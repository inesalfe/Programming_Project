# Programming_Project

This is the final project for the course in "Programming in C". This course is a first year course in the degree of Tecnological Physics Engeneering in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico - Universidade de Lisboa.

The goal of this project is to create a simulation using C and the visual interface GTK3 of the following physical system with one mass and two springs:

In this system, the block has mass $M$, the constant of both springs is $K$ and the pendulum has length $l$ and mass $m$. The mass m can only move horizontaly and friction will be ignored. The following initial conditions must be chosen by the user: masses - $M$ and $m$, the springs constant - $K$, the pendulum length - $l$, the initial pendulum angle - $\theta$, the initial position of mass $M$ - $x$, the initial angular velocity of the pendulum - $\omega$ and the initial velocity of mass $M$ - $v$.

The user can visualize real time plots of the mass M position, $x$, and / or the angle of the pendulum, $\theta$ has a function of time. Another possibility is the plot of the the evolution of $x$ with $\theta$.
